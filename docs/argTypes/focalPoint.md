**Media focal point coordinate**

The coordinate of the media area that should be preserved when it is cropped by the mask.

Similarly to [background-position](https://cssreference.io/property/background-position/) in CSS, it expects a pair of position keywords or percentage values representing the distance from the media top left corner to the focal point.

If a single value is passed, the second value is set to *"center"*.

Examples: `"top right"` `"center left"` `"25% 65%"`
